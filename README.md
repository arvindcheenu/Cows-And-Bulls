# Cows And Bulls

A JavaFx 8 Application that simulates the pen and paper game "Bulls and Cows" as a Desktop JavaFX application.

This application is built completely with Java with the UI View Built with JavaFx 8, the current mainstream standardisation for User interface design in Java. 

## Rules of the Game

The numerical version of this game is usually played with 4 digits, but can also be played with 3 or any other number of digits.This application handles guessing only a 4 digit number.

On a sheet of paper, the players each write a 4-digit secret number. The **digits must be all different**. Then, in turn, the players try to guess their opponent's number who gives the number of matches. If the matching digits are in their right positions, they are "bulls", if in different positions, they are "cows". 

#### Example

**Secret number**: 4271

**Opponent's try**: 1234

**Answer**: **1 bull** and **2 cows**. (The bull is "2", the cows are "4" and "1".)

In this Application, the number to be guessed is set by the System. And based on the user's guesses, provides hints for the user to solve. A little quirky addition in this iteration of this age-old game, is the **use of emojis**.
